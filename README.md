Contents:
* local_order_analysis.nb: Mathematica notebook containing all analysis code; produces plots used in the manuscript and supplementary text. Code originally developed in Wolfram Mathematica v13.2
* input_files/DF_centered_rectangular_20x20.png: image showing center-of-mass positions of individual colloids forming a centered rectangular lattice; consists of a 20um x 20um region
* input_files/DF_hexagonal_20x20.png: image showing center-of-mass positions of individual colloids forming a hexagonal lattice; consists of a 20um x 20um region
* input_files/DF_oblique_20x20.png: image showing center-of-mass positions of individual colloids forming an oblique lattice; consists of a 20um x 20um region
* input_files/DF_rectangular_20x20.png: image showing center-of-mass positions of individual colloids forming a rectangular lattice; consists of a 20um x 20um region
* input_files/DF_square_20x20.png: image showing center-of-mass positions of individual colloids forming a square lattice; consists of a 20um x 20um region

Note: for each of the above input files, the core particle diameter is taken to be 98 nm and the outer diameter is taken to be 346 nm
